CIBIL's aim is to fulfil the need of credit granting institutions for comprehensive credit information by collecting, collating and disseminating credit information pertaining to both commercial and consumer borrowers, to a closed user group of members. Banks, Financial Institutions, Non-Banking Financial Companies, Housing Finance Companies and Credit Card Companies use CIBIL's services. Data sharing is based on the Principle of Reciprocity, which means that only Members who have submitted all their credit data may access Credit Information Reports from CIBIL. The establishment of CIBIL is an effort made by the Government of India and the Reserve Bank of India to improve the functionality and stability of the Indian financial system by containing NPAs while improving credit grantors' portfolio quality. CIBIL provides a vital service, which allows its Members to make informed, objective and faster credit decisions. View more",loans

why should i invest in sip right now,"The current scenario in the equity market is dominated by negative sentiment, which has led to fundamentals being ignored. This scenario has created volatility in the markets and uncertainty of future outlook. The prudent way to invest in this scenario is to benefit from the volatility and this can be done by investing through SIPâ€™s. A monthly SIP helps in averaging out the cost of purchase and benefit from the power of compounding. It also helps in creating wealth over a longer time period. The current investment scenario is still dominated by negative sentiment. This creates volatility in the markets due to confused minds of the investors. Such volatility makes it difficult to capture the market movements and most people end up losing money with the intention of timing the markets. Also investing a lump sum in one shot might lead you to miss out on market opportunities. The tool to beat such a scenario is investing through a Systematic Investment Plan.",investments
